    "Imagine you have just finished the elimination portion of Gaussian Elimination. Your coefficient matrix is a 3x3 matrix and after elimination it is now an upper triangular matrix such that your system of equations has a unique solution. In order to find the solution using Gaussian Elimination, you will need to perform **backsubstitution**. Write a user function that takes a 3x4 augmented matrix in echelon form as it's argument, and returns a column vector of the solution. For this question, assume the coeffiecient matrix is upper triangular when it is in echelon form. Make sure to call your function to test it. You do not need to provide a handwritten answer to this question - only your code."
